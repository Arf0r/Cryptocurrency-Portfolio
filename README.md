# Cryptocurrency Portfolio
App for android that allows the user to easily keep track of his/her cryptocurrency holdings. The user inputs how much of 
which cryptocurrency he/she is holding and at which price they were bought, and the app will show the current value of each 
individual crypto holding as well as the total value of the portfolio.

## Problem
With the rising popularity of cryptocurrency, many new private investers are coming into the crypto markets. For those 
buyers who are interested in making big bucks, altcoins are the way to go as their prices can shoot up over 300% in a 
matter of days. Buying different altcoins however is often done on different exchange website and thus the user does not 
have a clear overview of his or her total crypto holdings. This app will give the user a clear overview of his or her 
total holdings.

## API
I will make use of the website https://min-api.cryptocompare.com which provides a JSON API usable for my app. 
the API is update with current prices regularly and is free to use for up to 100000 calls per month, which should 
be more than enough for my personal use and testing.
